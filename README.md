### Another Relevant Image

<img src="./assets/automation-ftw.jpg" alt="A man is crawling in a desert with the text 'Programmers' underneath him. There are two signs. The one on the left reads 'Automate it in 10 hours: 21 Miles'. The one on the right reads '10 min easy solution: 1/4 mile'. The man is crawling to the left, implying that programmers would rather automate a task in 10 hours, rather than taking the easy 10 minute solution." style="width:50%; height:auto;">
